SUMMARY="Java-based Ruby interpreter implementation"
DESCRIPTION="
JRuby is a Java implementation of the Ruby programming language, being developed
by the JRuby team. JRuby is tightly integrated with Java to allow the embedding
of the interpreter into any Java application with full two-way access between 
the Java and the Ruby code (similar to Jython for the Python language).
