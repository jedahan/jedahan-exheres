SUMMARY="A Simple OpenSoundControl implementation, in Pure Python"
DESCRIPTION="
This module is loosely based on the good old ‘SimpleOSC’ implementation by
Daniel Holth & Clinton McChesney. It has been mostly rewritten, and a whole set
of new Classes has been added, providing support for OSC-bundles, a simple
OSC-client, a simple OSC-server, threading & forking OSC-servers and a more
complex ‘Multiple-Unicast’ OSC-client that supports subscriptions and OSC-
address based message-filtering.
