SUMMARY="provides a pure-Python interface to Apple Bonjour and compatible
DNS-SD libraries (such as Avahi)"
DESCRIPTION="
pybonjour provides a pure-Python interface to Apple Bonjour and compatible
DNS-SD libraries (such as Avahi). It allows Python scripts to take advantage
of Zero Configuration Networking (Zeroconf) to register, discover, and resolve
services on both local and wide-area networks. Since pybonjour is implemented
in pure Python, scripts that use it can easily be ported to Mac OS X, Windows,
Linux, and other systems that run Bonjour.
