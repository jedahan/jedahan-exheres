SUMMARY="Python wrapper for Tk themed (Ttk) widgets"
DESCRIPTION="
This ttk wrapper provides classes to allow using the Tk themed widget set, as
well some extensions, under Python.

Ttk is based on a revised and enhanced version of TIP #48 (http://tip.tcl.tk/48)
specified style engine.

Its basic idea is to separate, to the extent possible, the code implementing a
widget's behavior from the code implementing its appearance. Widget class
bindings are primarily responsible for maintaining the widget state and invoking
callbacks, all aspects of the widgets appearance lies at Themes.
